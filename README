Overview

Hello, and welcome to The Great Global Hackerspace Challenge, brought to you by the very excited folks over at element14!
You are one of thirty hackerspaces from across the globe who have been chosen to participate in this amazing event, which seeks to stretch your hackerspace-minded ingenuity to its very limit to create an electronics build that will make a real, and very positive difference in an educational establishment. And for you to have a whole lot of fun along the way!
Exactly what that build is, and what solution it provides is entirely down to you. The only stipulation is that your build must make use of a microcontroller and a portable power source. We encourage you to reach out to an educational institute in your area so that you can test your invention as it evolves, make sure you are answering a genuine educational need, and hopefully establish a home for your product once the challenge is over.
